  summary: AWS Command Line Interface plugin to start and end sessions
  description: |
    Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that
    lets you manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances,
    on-premises instances and virtual machines. Session Manager provides
    secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound
    ports. When you use the Session Manager plugin with the AWS CLI to start a
    session, the plugin builds the websocket connection to your managed
    instances.
